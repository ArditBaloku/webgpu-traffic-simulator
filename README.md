# WebGPU Traffic Simulator

This repository holds the code of a traffic simulator written in JavaScript and WebGPU for my master's thesis

## Usage

To run the code you'll need the [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension. Start the preview server and visit localhost:3000 on your browser. Make sure your browser supports WebGPU.
