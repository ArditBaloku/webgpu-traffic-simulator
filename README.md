# webgpu-traffic-simulator

## Todo:

- [x] Cars react to each other by slowing down if they're going to hit another car
- [x] Cars speed up when the road is clear
- [x] Cars check the roundabout when entering to see if a car is there
- [ ] Cars randomly slow down based on some probability
- [x] Traffic lights
- [x] Roads connect to all roads correctly and not just the one with the same node id
- [ ] Cars are generated at certain points and have a full path
- [ ] Cars are generated based on some traffic data
- [x] Interpolate extra points in OSM data so that the roads are smoother
- [x] Port to GPU
